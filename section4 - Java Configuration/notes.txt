- components scan
    - if components are in a different package outside the package
    where the current application class is
    - we can use @ComponentScan("package1")
    this annotation before the application class

- the java configuration to configure beans is better for situations
where you can't use @Component and @Profile because you don't have access to the code
You are using 3rd party libraries

- in spring is possible to wire up the factory pattern
    - commonly seen when we configure databases
    or jms (java message service) connections
