- spring profiles are used when we want to wire different components (beans)
- in the application properties file we can activate a profile by doing:
    - spring.profiles.active = profile1;
- you can set beans to be used with the default profile by using
the annotation @Profile("dev")
    - you can even specify more than one
    @Profile({"default","dev","qa"});
