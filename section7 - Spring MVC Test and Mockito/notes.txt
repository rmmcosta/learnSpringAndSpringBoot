- Spring MVC Test
    - testing framework for the spring mvc controllers
    - works by mocking a web context (web contexts are highly decoupled in spring)
        that allows us to test the web requests and the interactions with 
        the dispatcher servlet
    - we can test:
        - handler mappings
        - url parameters
        - parameter bindings
        - request type mappings 
    - since we don't need to bring the spring context (it will be mocked)
    the unit test will remain very fast

- Junit (framework to do unit testing) is used in conjunction with the
spring mvc test framework
    - junit doesn't have native mocking facilities
    - use mockito for that instead

- classes:
    - MockMvc
        - MockMvcBuilders
        - standalone setup
        - perform method to perform the request
        - andExpect to define what to expect:
            status().isOk()
            view().name('viewname')

- use spring mvc test and mockito for a crud controller
